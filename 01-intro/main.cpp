int main() // C++ programs start by executing the function main
{
    cout << "Hello, World!\n"; // output “He llo, World!”
    keep_window_open();        // wait for a character to be entered
    return 0;
}

// 1. What is the purpose of the “Hello, World!” program?
// test the correct setup of the environment

// 2. Name the four parts of a function.
// return type, name(or identifier) of the function, optional list of parameters, body of function

// 3. Name a function that must appear in every C++ program.
// main 

// 4. In the “Hello, World!” program, what is the purpose of the line return 0;?
// end the program

// 5. What is the purpose of the compiler?
// compiler takes the source code and create the object code(machine code or executable)

// 6. What is the purpose of the #include directive?
// Instructs the computer to make available facilities from a file called std_lib_facilities.h

// 7. What does a .h suffix at the end of a file name signify in C++?
// A header file contains definitions of terms that we use in our program.

// 8. What does the linker do for your program?
// link together the resulting object code files to form an executable program. 

// 9. What is the difference between a source file and an object file?
// source file is human readable(c++ file), object file is machine readable(machine code). source file -> compiler -> object file

// 10. What is an IDE and what does it do for you?
// IDE id Integrated development environment, simplify the programming
// IDEs usually include an editor with helpful features like color coding to help distinguish between
// comments, keywords, and other parts of your program source code, plus other facilities to help you
// debug your code, compile it, and run it. Debugging is the activity of finding errors in a program and
// removing them;

// 11. If you understand everything in the textbook, why is it necessary to practice?
// because is essential in the learning process and reinforce your practical programming skills and give you experience with programming environment tools.
